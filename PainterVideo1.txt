Substance painter is a 3D modeling paint program that alows you to lay substances ontop of 3D models.
In the first video they talk about PBR, PBR is a more realistic way to render textures. It uses real
world proporties to determain where the shades and lights are layed out. It not only makes it easier 
to create realistic looking textures, but it can also be used to make stylistic textures. Later it 
goes into details about the PBR workflow, or the layers of how it all works. Each layer gives off 
details that all lead up to the full blown texture. Base color, roughness, matalic, diffuse, 
glossyness, normals, etc. They all play a roll in the final texture.
