Particals seem to be another setting along with brushes that give the brush stroke life and
an action path. When creating a stroke, the particals can interact differently with the 
stroke that was given. For example, one stroke can smear particals down the pathway of the
stroke. This gives a new lively feel to the stroke. You can change the stroke settings by 
giving the appearence of heavier/lighter gravity and wind, these effect the smear direction,
length, and thickness.
