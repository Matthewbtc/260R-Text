Layer masks work in two ways, and to me there can be a little confusing. There is a white and
a black layer mask, and they both work in different ways. The white mask works as a remover,
whatever you paint on your layer will be gone, youre essentially removing your layer paint.
However, with the black layer mask it is the opposite. Starting out with no visable layer
you paint onto it what you want to see of the layer. Using the black layer mask in a practical
setting, you could use the fill brush (partical) to fill in a surface to the edge. The fill 
brush will spread till it hits the edge of the normal map data.
