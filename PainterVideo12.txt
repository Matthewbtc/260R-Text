To creat a good weathered look, you need to use layers. Layers that stack ontop of eachother
become very useful on this process. Having a bace layer, in the video the paint, on top will 
give the appearence that whatever shows underneath is coated with something. Adding a black 
layer mask will enable you to take away from the paint layer and reveal whatever it is you 
want to show underneath, in this case metal. You dont even need to paint out all the deatils,
you can go into proporties, and select a generaor that will randomly create some kind of
weathered look.
