The projection tool allows the user to project an image onto the mesh, hence the name. The
projection tool is mainly used with a full material. Where as the stensile is used as a 
secondary screen space mask. What that means is that an image is projected as a layer over 
your mesh. Like the black layer mask, you paint where the brush strokes were made; however,
the brush strokes mirror the textures that where the projected in the projected layer. This
can leave cool, easy, and time saving designs instead of creating one of your own and importing.
