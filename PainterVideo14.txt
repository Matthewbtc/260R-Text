Smart materials are actually a collection of layers within a layer stack that have been saved as a 
preset material. This make possible for complex materials, such as makeing layers apon layers of 
different textures. Not only can it be a compilation of textures, but of different effects too. Its
sort of like making a spice cake, blending all the ingredients into one bowl to make something with lots 
of flavors. Some of those ingredients are essencial for it to be a cake (or appear to be a metal texture)
but some are added for detailed effects. These materials can be saved and imprinted apon other objects.
You can also change the details of a smart material once added to another object, so to make the objects 
seem realistc and slightly different. In order for this auto connection to work, the textures need to
be placed in the additional map imputs.
