Substance painter is a way for objects to emenate real testures while actually being 
completely flat surfaced.The second video is all about starting your file the right way,
and the first step do doing it right is to know where your substances are going in the end.
Working withing an uploaded file you can change and edit the mesh however, this will re-
compute the layout.Along with that you actually cannot add, nor delete mesh materials from 
the project. Now that doesnt mean you cant change the polygons or the UV layout. Baking 
seems to be solidifying the changes and matching it to the UV's.
