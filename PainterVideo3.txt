In the third painter video you see that a lot of where the materials are, are placed 
similarly to substance designer. They are each in their own little category, the textures,
the paterns, the backgrounds, etc. One category that seems new is the tools, which contains
brushes and material settings. Im porting your own textures is simple, you just drag it over 
and place it into the program. Whats nice is that it stays within its categoric area. However,
these imports will not be perminant outside of the current project. If you want the materials 
to be perminant you will have to place them in the shelf folder, inside the substance painter 
folder.
