Painter uses textures as paints that you can spash onto an object, or a material in the program.
Materials are the actual 3D model that you have created in Maya or some other 3D rendering program,
it is improted into Painter where you are able to paint textures onto them. Before you import them 
into Painter however you should make the materials into set groups. Having the materials not in 
groups can lead to many problems including painting on all the wrong 3D materials. Setting your 
materials into groups may also leads to a better, and mor organized display of your final product.
