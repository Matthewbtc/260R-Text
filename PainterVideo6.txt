in the 3D view port you can hold down the alt button to move around and pivot the 3D model. The
shift key however, changes the casting light's angle. You can also view your model in a 2D perspecive.
This will unfold the object but keeps the lighting as interactive as it was in the 3D perspective.
You can also view the hight, base color, or matalic to view your model as a whole in one of those 
settings. In the hight mask you can actually personalize the hights color to whichever fits your needs
best. This will change the black and white to a blue red, or yellow gree, any color combo you want.
