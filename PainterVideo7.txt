Layers in painter work much like the layers in photoshop, or any other program with layers. The 
layer that is on top in the layer list is also on top of the painted layers. So painting dirt
onto a red testure, you would want the dirt to be on the top layer. This makes the dirt look as
though it was slapped onto the red. When placing a noise onto a model use planer to rid of any
unwanted seams that may occur, making it a seamless projector. When you have plastered the model
with a texture, if it starts to warp or unalign, just use the tri-planer projection and it will 
align in unison.
