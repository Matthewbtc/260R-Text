Painting onto the channel is like painting the texture you want on your 3D object. Its a little hard 
to explain, but the more rough you want something the darker you would want it to be painted. This 
system works kind of like a gradient scale, white being smooth and black being rough. And also, if you
create a decent amount of the texture you want on a surface, and yet the texture feels too strong, in 
the layer you can lower the opacity and make it look and feel less intence. You can also use this you 
your advantage to mix textures to get the ideal texture you want.
