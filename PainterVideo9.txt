When you paint in the viewport you paint with both the brush settings and also with the material 
that you have selected. Its combonation of the two that gives you the aparent textures on your 3D
model. If you change one, the other will stay the same. This can give you a number of different 
looks and styles in your textures. Painting and using the brush in the 2D mode can give you seamless
smooth strokes. However, it will bleed over to another side if you are not careful. Select alignment
to UV if you want the brush strokes to stay within the UV mapping.
